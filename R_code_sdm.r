#plot vegetation

#now we want to create the model to link all the variables: presences vs predictors (all together)
#that's the space that we hacÃ¬ve seen in multivarite analysis
#use the function sdm() but first we have to specify the data to the model 1) points 2) environmental varibales
#to select the data = sdmData() train arguments = training datatset
datasdm <- sdmData(train=species, predictors=preds)  #train = object in which we've sotred the species data

#we want to modelle the occurences vs environmental varibales 
model <- sdm(Occurrence ~ elevation + precipitation + temperature + vegetation, data = datasdm, methods = "glm")
#glm = generalised linear model = linear model in several dimensions
#DIFFRENT MODEL AVAILBLES => WHICH IS THE BEST? make comparison

#create the map  of the model using predict()
p1 <- predict(model, newdata=preds)  #making a map based on the model and on the data that are the predictors

#final stack predictors and p1
s1 <- stack(preds, p1)
plot(s1) #predictions (possibility of occurrences) + predictors (environmental conditions)

#it allow us to predirre dove si trova una specie quando non abbiamo abbastanza dati sperimentali
